# Deno Blocks

## Overview

- **Prompt**:
  [Build a Cloud IDE for the Deno Subhosting Hackathon](https://deno.com/blog/subhosting-hackathon).
- **Demo URL**: [blocks.deno.dev](https://blocks.deno.dev)

For the Deno Subhosting Hackathon, I've developed a
[Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly) workspace in
[Fresh](https://github.com/denoland/fresh) that makes it easy to visually define
instrumentation of Deno Subhosting API endpoints, which themselves are
effortlessly provisioned and deployed.

## Known issues/future work

- UI accessibility.
- Add environment variables to deployment.

## References

- <https://deno.com/blog/subhosting-hackathon>

## Development

Make sure to install Deno:
<https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation>

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
